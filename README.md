# php-text-generator
Fast SEO text generator on a mask.

Written in PHP. I do not use regular expressions and the fastest.
I covered tests and simple! Supporting recursive text generation rules.
It supports multiple encodings.

This package implements the functionality of a similar package for Go Lang â€“ [text-generator](https://github.com/liderman/text-generator).
